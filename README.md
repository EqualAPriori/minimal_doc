# Minimal code templates for setting up documentation.

The default (`material`) branch is a minimal setup for `mkdocs`, using the material theme, and with common settings enabled (e.g. latex, autodoc navigation generation, jupyter notebooks). There is also a branch that uses the ReadTheDocs theme.

The tutorials and crash course can be found [https://equalapriori.github.io/minimal_doc/](https://equalapriori.github.io/minimal_doc/). This page is particularly relevant for [installing all the relevant packages to use mkdocs](https://equalapriori.github.io/minimal_doc/mkdocs/). The contents of the tutorials are managed in the [`example` branch of this repository](https://github.com/EqualAPriori/minimal_doc/tree/example).

In the future I'll add a `sphinx` minimal example.
